 [意]但丁 著  
钱稻孙 译

方吾生之半路  
恍余处乎幽林，   
失正轨而迷误。  
道其况兮不可禁  
林荒蛮以惨烈  
言念及之复怖心！  
戚其苦兮死何择：  
惟获益之足谘，  
愿覼缕其所历。  
奚自入兮不复怀；  
余梦寐而未觉，  
遂离弃夫真馗。  
既来遇乎山足，    
极深谷之陲边，  
怖吾心其久缚束，  
用仰望兮见山肩  
美星光之既布，  
将纷涂之万象兮正导夫路先，  
始少释余怖惧，  
潜心湖以为殃，  
竟长夜兮予苦，  
譬彼喘息之未遑，  
方出海而登陆，  
辄反观夫危波之茫茫；  
余兹时兮怖犹伏，  
亦临睨夫故途，  
悼生还其有孰。  
毕休息兮予痡，  
复倚陂以陟步，  
低下贱其侧胫之既稣；  
愕彼阪巅兮是踞，  
一豹轻疾以儇儇，  
斑文皮其纷错，  
觌予面而不迁；  
阻塞予之所往，  
余不自知踵之频旋。  
属晨光之昧爽；  
日与众星以俱升  
惟此众星与日兮故尝相与而同上  
美象始运于神爱兮亦若是其跻腾；  
曼兴予之嘉望  
缅此文兽之烝烝 ，  
惟兹晷刻兮韶光骀荡：  
乃犹未能兮使予无惶  
复有一狮兮露面为障。  
奔向余兮猖狂  
昂首以饥剧，  
空气亦若慑而不张：  
有牝狼兮癯瘠  
似凡贪之所藏，  
已多人其逢厄。  
痛余心兮忧惕  
赌容貌之可畏，  
遂并崇愿而丧亡。  
夫人皆然兮志方遂，  
骤挫抑而不可为。  
孰不衷怀兮悲泪：  
兽余逼兮复若斯，  
逐步步其相迫  
将返予乎日默之涯。  
余方下降夫卑泽，  
忽有物兮袭予  
声嘶嗄兮若久寂。  
迨相遇于平区，  
亦我恤兮予諰，  
影抑人兮其孰居。  
对曰否兮古之士，  
朕考妣为隆巴提，  
满都乏你兮并同里。  
我生猷溜世而犹迟，  
卜居罗马兮忻逢奥古斯督，  
尔其时兮众神分乖。  
尝为诗人兮咏彼纯笃  
安基斯之子兮从脱罗亚而来迁，  
既伊里翁之宏都兮焚毁而不禄。  
羌还返乎烦冤？  
曷登陟兮权喜岳，  
胥由是兮乐始颁？  
岂君维琪尔兮惟言之澳，  
文章泉湧兮洪流汤汤？  
余【忄典】靦而自惭兮报言局促。  
猗嗟乎诗友之荣光，  
毋虚我久学而深爱，  
数数研寻兮维子之章。  
君吾师兮吾所志：  
惟子一人兮黾勉予修，  
美文辞兮声誉攸賫。  
觑彼兽兮予回面之所由：  
亦予救乎高名宿慧，  
彼使予兮脉乱而心怮  
为君谋兮宜他诣，  
悯予泪面以慰安，  
苟此荒蛮之将遰：  
今兹兽兮俾尔涕潸，  
曾不容人兮济渡，  
横杀戮以相阑；  
性奸险而乖忤，  
欲贪婪以无穷，  
甫得食而饥反怒。  
既群兽与联宗，  
弥增益兮滋蔓  
待灵犴之歼凶。  
犴非财土之所豢，  
惟智爱德是眷求，  
斐德罗与斐德罗兮彼居其间。  
将平阳意大利兮鸿被厥庥，  
烈女康弭拉兮尝于兹蒙毒，  
并欧里亚洛与都尔诺兮尼朔与诸前修。  
彼当遍都邑兮驰逐，  
终还放之幽都，  
故所从来兮为妬促。  
余今兹兮为君图，  
莫若从予之所导  
往偕游乎永劫之墟。  
常闻绝望之叫啕，  
见故鬼之怊怊，  
惟第二死兮是祷：  
又将逢彼之逍遥  
居火中以期迟，  
待跻列夫幸福之曹：  
若更有志于高迈，  
当从胜我之所招：  
予其委君以自退：  
天帝治兮自彼霄，  
昭法度之未奉，  
禁予导夫帝郊。  
帝玄黄兮垂拱，  
此清都兮帝宫。  
呜呼幸兮渥兹宠！  
曰诗人兮请从  
托神惠之独赍，  
祆今祸以除来凶，  
愿予导兮偕逝，  
仰圣彼得之天门，  
并徧观夫吾子所诲。  
默默而前兮，仆仆其予遵。  

【忄典】（tiǎn，惭愧）

The Divine Comedy  
by DANTE ALIGHIERI(1265-1321)  
translated by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  
(1807-1882)  
Incipit Comoedia Dantis Alagherii,  
Florentini natione, non moribus.  
INFERNO  
Inferno: Canto I  

Midway upon the journey of our life  
I found myself within a forest dark,  
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.  

Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say  
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,    
Which in the very thought renews the fear.  

So bitter is it, death is little more;  
But of the good to treat, which there I found,  
Speak will I of the other things I saw there.  

I cannot well repeat how there I entered,  
So full was I of slumber at the moment  
In which I had abandoned the true way.  

But after I had reached a mountain's foot,  
At that point where the valley terminated,  
Which had with consternation pierced my heart,

Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,  
Vested already with that planet's rays  
Which leadeth others right by every road.

Then was the fear a little quieted  
That in my heart's lake had endured throughout  
The night, which I had passed so piteously.

And even as he, who, with distressful breath,  
Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,  
Turns to the water perilous and gazes;  

So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,  
Turn itself back to re-behold the pass  
Which never yet a living person left.

After my weary body I had rested,  
The way resumed I on the desert slope,  
So that the firm foot ever was the lower.

And lo! almost where the ascent began,  
A panther light and swift exceedingly,  
Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!

And never moved she from before my face,  
Nay, rather did impede so much my way,  
That many times I to return had turned.

The time was the beginning of the morning,  
And up the sun was mounting with those stars  
That with him were, what time the Love Divine

At first in motion set those beauteous things;  
So were to me occasion of good hope,  
The variegated skin of that wild beast,

The hour of time, and the delicious season;      
But not so much, that did not give me fear  
A lion's aspect which appeared to me.

He seemed as if against me he were coming  
With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,  
So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;

And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings  
Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,  
And many folk has caused to live forlorn!

She brought upon me so much heaviness,  
With the affright that from her aspect came,  
That I the hope relinquished of the height.

And as he is who willingly acquires,  
And the time comes that causes him to lose,  
Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,

E'en such made me that beast withouten peace,  
Which, coming on against me by degrees  
 Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.

While I was rushing downward to the lowland,     
Before mine eyes did one present himself,     
Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.     

When I beheld him in the desert vast,     
"Have pity on me," unto him I cried,     
"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!"

He answered me: "Not man; man once I was,     
And both my parents were of Lombardy,     
And Mantuans by country both of them.

'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late,     
And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,     
During the time of false and lying gods.     
A poet was I, and I sang that just     
Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,     
After that Ilion the superb was burned.

But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?     
Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable,     
Which is the source and cause of every joy?"

"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain     
Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?"     
I made response to him with bashful forehead.

"O, of the other poets honour and light,     
Avail me the long study and great love     
That have impelled me to explore thy volume!

Thou art my master, and my author thou,     
Thou art alone the one from whom I took     
The beautiful style that has done honour to me.

Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;     
Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,     
For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble."

"Thee it behoves to take another road,"     
Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,     
"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;

Because this beast, at which thou criest out,     
Suffers not any one to pass her way,     
But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;

And has a nature so malign and ruthless,     
That never doth she glut her greedy will,     
And after food is hungrier than before.

Many the animals with whom she weds,     
And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound     
Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.

He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,     
But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;     
'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;

Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,     
On whose account the maid Camilla died,     
Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;

Through every city shall he hunt her down,     
Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,     
There from whence envy first did let her loose.

Therefore I think and judge it for thy best     
Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,     
And lead thee hence through the eternal place,

Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,     
Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,     
Who cry out each one for the second death;

And thou shalt see those who contented are     
Within the fire, because they hope to come,     
Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people;

To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,     
A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;     
With her at my departure I will leave thee;

Because that Emperor, who reigns above,     
In that I was rebellious to his law,     
Wills that through me none come into his city.

He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;     
There is his city and his lofty throne;     
O happy he whom thereto he elects!"     

And I to him: "Poet, I thee entreat,     
By that same God whom thou didst never know,     
So that I may escape this woe and worse,

Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,     
That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,     
And those thou makest so disconsolate."

Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.
