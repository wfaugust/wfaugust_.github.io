Under the greenwood tree		 				   绿树高张翠幕，   
Who loves to lie with me,					  	     谁来谐我偃卧，   
And turn his merry note						 		翻将欢乐心声，   
Unto the sweet bird's throat—			  		学唱枝头鸟鸣：   
Come hither, come hither, come hither!	 盍来此？盍来此？盍来此？   
Here shall he see											 目之所接，   
No enemy                  								       精神契一，   
But winter and rough weather.					唯忧雨雪之将至。

Who doth ambition shun							   孰能敝屣尊荣，   
And loves to live i' the sun,							来沐丽日光风，   
Seeking the food he eats							   觅食自求果腹，   
And pleased with what he gets—				 一饱欣然意足：   
Come hither, come hither, come hither!     盍来此？盍来此？盍来此？   
Here shall he see											 目之所接，   
No enemy														 精神契一，   
But winter and rough weather.					唯忧雨雪之将至。
