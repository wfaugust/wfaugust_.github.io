In me, past, present, future meet  

To hold long chiding conference.    
My lusts usurp the present tense  
And strangle Reason in his seat.      
My loves leap through the future's fence   
To dance with dream-enfranchised feet.   

In me the cave-man clasps the seer,   
And garlanded Apollo goes   
Chanting to Abraham's deaf ear.   
In me the tiger sniffs the rose.   
Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble,   
Since there your elements assemble

于我, 过去, 现在以及未来.        
商讨聚会, 各执一词, 纷扰不息。      
林林总总的欲望, 掠取着我的现在      
将'理性'扼杀于它的宝座      
我的爱情纷纷越过未来的藩篱      
梦想解放出双脚，舞蹈着

于我，穴居者攫取了先知      
佩带花环的阿波罗      
向亚伯拉罕的聋耳边吟唱      
我心里有猛虎在细嗅着蔷薇      
审视我的内心吧，亲爱的朋友，你应战栗      
因为那才是你本来的面目
